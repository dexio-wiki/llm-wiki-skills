Use when a new source disagrees with a page, when two pages disagree, or when a fact on a page may no longer be true."

# Resolve conflicts in a wiki

The costliest wiki error is not a missing fact but a wrong one that looks settled. It usually
arrives as a quiet overwrite: a newer source, or a newer agent, replaces a claim without
checking whether the old one was better sourced. The next agent cites the new line, and the
error compounds.

## Decide which case you are in

1. **Superseded.** The old claim was true then and something changed: a price moved, a
   decision was reversed, a person changed roles. Replace the claim, keep a dated line of what
   it replaced when the history matters ("Was $8 until 2026-09-01"), and cite the new source.
2. **Corrected.** The old claim was wrong. Replace it, cite the evidence, and say in the
   change note that it was a correction and what was wrong. Search the wiki for other pages
   that repeated the wrong claim and fix them too.
3. **Unresolved.** Two sources disagree and neither is clearly authoritative. Keep both
   (format below), mark the page, and escalate if it matters.
4. **Not a conflict.** Different scopes, dates or definitions ("users" versus "paying users").
   Make the difference explicit on the page so the next reader does not see a conflict.

## How to judge authority

In rough order:

1. The system of record, checked now: the live config, the contract, the account, the
   person who decided.
2. A primary source: the organization's own filing, docs or data, dated.
3. A careful secondary source that shows its method.
4. Vendor claims about themselves, self-reports, and aggregators.
5. Anything recalled rather than read.

Newer beats older only within the same tier. A dated primary source beats a newer blog post
that does not cite one.

## Recording an unresolved conflict

On the page, next to the claim:

```markdown
Monthly active users: disputed.
- 24,700 (company blog, 2026-08-14, vendor-sourced)
- about 9,000 (third-party panel estimate, 2026-09-02; counts web only)
Not resolved as of 2026-09-28; the panel cannot see API usage.
```

In the frontmatter, set `contested: true` and lower `confidence` if the page carries one.
When it is resolved, remove the flag, keep the winning claim with its source, and say in the
note what settled it.

## Escalate

Escalate to a person, rather than choosing, when the conflict bears on a decision, money, a
commitment to someone outside, or a claim other pages rely on. Say what conflicts, the
sources on each side, which you think is right and why, and what would settle it.

## Stale claims

A claim can be wrong without any contradicting source: it was simply true a year ago. When
you find one (from `wiki-lint`'s stale list or while reading), recheck it at the source.
If it holds, bump `updated` and note that you rechecked it. If you cannot recheck it now,
add a `stale_after` date or an inline "as of" date so readers know how old it is.

## Pitfalls

- Resolving by recency alone.
- Deleting the losing claim without a trace. History keeps it, but the next reader will not
  look at history; one dated line saves them re-adding it.
- Fixing one page and leaving the claim on the three pages that copied it. Search for it.
