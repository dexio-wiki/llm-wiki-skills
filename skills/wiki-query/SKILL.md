# Answer from a wiki

A wiki earns its upkeep when answers come from it faster and better than from scratch, and
when good answers are kept so the next question starts further ahead.

## Steps

1. **Orient on the question** (`wiki-orient`): search two or three phrasings, read the
   canonical page and the neighbors that bear on it.
2. **Answer from what you read, and cite it.** Give the page paths the answer rests on. If
   you combine pages, say so. If a page's claim carries a trust label (vendor-sourced,
   estimate, unverified), carry the label into the answer.
3. **Check mutable facts at their source** before presenting them as current: prices,
   configuration, account state, who holds a role, anything with a date older than the
   decision it will feed. Say what you checked. If the source disagrees with the wiki, the
   answer uses the source and the wiki gets fixed (`wiki-record` or `wiki-conflicts`).
4. **Say what the wiki does not cover.** "The wiki has nothing on X" is a useful answer; a
   plausible guess presented as if it came from the wiki is a harmful one. If you fill the
   gap from outside research, mark which parts came from where.
5. **File the answer back when it is substantial.** If the answer needed several pages,
   outside research, or a judgment worth keeping, write it as a query page (below). Trivial
   lookups are not filed.
6. **Fix what you found on the way.** A broken link, a stale date, a missing link between two
   pages you needed together: fix it with a small edit and a note, or report it.

## Query page

Under `queries/` (or where the schema puts them), named for the question:

title: Which vendors include SSO on their base plan?

# Which vendors include SSO on their base plan?

Question (who asked, date).

## Short answer
Two to four sentences.

## Evidence
What was consulted, with links to wiki pages and sources, and the numbers that carry the
answer.

## Confidence and gaps
What would change the answer, and what was not checked.
```

Link the query page from the pages it draws on when it adds something they lack, so the
answer is found from the topic and not only by search. When a follow-up question arrives in
the same thread, add it as a section of the same query page rather than a new page.

## Pitfalls

- Answering from memory with the wiki open. If you did not read it in the wiki or a source
  this session, it is unverified; say so.
- Citing a page for a claim the page does not make. Quote or paraphrase closely enough that
  the reader can find the sentence.
- Filing every answer. A `queries/` folder full of one-line lookups buries the real
  syntheses.
