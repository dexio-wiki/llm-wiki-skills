# Record something in a wiki

The wiki is only as good as what goes in and where it lands. Two failures account for most of
the mess in agent-kept wikis: new pages for topics that already have one, and whole-page
rewrites that silently drop what another writer added. Both are avoided by searching first and
editing small.

## Does it belong?

Record it if someone (a person or another agent) will need it again and could not cheaply
rederive it:

- decisions, with the date, who made them and why
- verified facts about the organization, its systems, its customers or its market
- procedures that worked, and the pitfalls found on the way
- synthesized answers that took real research (file those with `wiki-query`)

Leave it out:

- routine progress, TODOs, and status that will be stale in a week
- raw transcripts or chat logs (keep a source under `raw/` via `wiki-ingest` if it matters)
- commit hashes, PR numbers, and other details the code host already records
- secrets of any kind: tokens, keys, passwords, connection strings, payment details
- anything private a person has not said is fine to share with everyone who reads the wiki

## Steps

1. **Search for the owning page** (`wiki-orient`, step 4). One topic, one page. If a page
   covers the topic, you are editing it, even if you would have organized it differently.
2. **Create a page only past the threshold.** A new page is justified when the subject is
   likely to matter again, appears in several sources, or is central to one authoritative
   source. A passing mention goes on the page that mentions it. Put the page in the folder
   the schema assigns to its kind, with a lowercase hyphenated file name.
3. **Make the smallest edit that records it.** Change the section that is wrong or add a line
   to the section it belongs in. Rewrite a whole page only when you created it in this task
   or the page is being deliberately restructured (`wiki-refactor`).
4. **Write the claim so it survives.**
   - Date anything that can change: "Team plan is $10 a member (pricing page, read
     2026-09-28)", not "Team plan is $10".
   - Say where it came from: a source URL, a raw file, a person and date, or the page it was
     derived from. Put the source next to the claim if the page has several sources.
   - Label trust when it is not first-hand: vendor-published numbers as vendor-sourced,
     anything recalled rather than read as unverified, estimates as estimates.
   - For a decision: what was decided, when, by whom, the reason, and what it replaced.
5. **Update the frontmatter.** Bump `updated`. Add the source to `sources`. Make sure
   `description` still says what the page holds after your change. New pages get the full
   frontmatter the schema asks for; the default is:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Page Title
   description: One line on what the page answers or holds.
   created: YYYY-MM-DD
   updated: YYYY-MM-DD
   type: entity | concept | comparison | procedure | decision | query | summary
   tags: [from-the-schema-taxonomy]
   sources: [where the content came from]
   ---
   ```
6. **Link it.** Link the new content to the pages it depends on, and link to it from the one
   or two pages a reader would come from. Aim for at least two useful links on a new page.
   If you mention another page's subject by name, make it a link.
7. **Leave a change note.** Git: a commit message saying what changed and why, one change per
   commit. Hosted wiki: the `note` field on the write, with your agent name. "Add Q3 pricing
   from vendor page; replaces August figure" is a note. "Update page" is not.
8. **Tell the person what you recorded and where**, by path, in one line.

## Conflicts

If what you are recording contradicts the page, do not overwrite it. Follow `wiki-conflicts`:
check dates and provenance, keep both claims if it is unresolved, and flag it.

## Pitfalls

- Appending a new dated section to the bottom of a page every time. The page becomes a log
  and the current answer is buried. Update the section the fact belongs in; history keeps the
  old version.
- Recording your own inference as a finding. Mark it as your read ("likely", "our estimate")
  and give the evidence it rests on.
- Several lists agreeing is not corroboration when they were drawn from the same place. Name
  what a source could and could not have seen before quoting a rate from it.
- Writing for yourself. Write for an agent that has never seen this conversation.
