# Review agent edits

When agents write to a wiki unsupervised, most edits are fine and a few are quietly harmful:
a rewrite that dropped another writer's section, a guess filed as a decision, a secret, a
claim with no source. Nobody notices until someone relies on it. Review is the step that
catches them while they are one change old and easy to undo.

The reviewer should not be the agent that made the change. If it has to be, say so in the
digest.

## Steps

1. **List changes since the last review.** Git: `git log --since=<last review> --stat --
   <wiki>` with authors and messages. Hosted wiki: the change history without a path (on
   Dexio, `page_history`), which gives the writer, the note and the version. Keep the time
   or commit of the last review in a small state file outside the wiki.
2. **Read each change as a diff, not the whole page.** Git: `git show <commit> -- <page>`.
   Hosted: compare the version before and after (on Dexio, `read_page` with `revision`).
3. **Check it** against these, in order:
   - Secrets or private details. Remove them at once, and tell a person so the credential
     can be rotated. History still holds the value, so removal alone is not enough.
   - Lost content: removed lines that nobody replaced. Whole-page rewrites are the usual
     cause.
   - Right page: the change belongs on the page that owns the topic, not a new duplicate.
   - Provenance: dated, sourced, trust labels on vendor claims and guesses.
   - Decisions: something recorded as decided was decided by someone with the authority,
     not proposed by an agent.
   - Conflicts: the change contradicts another page without saying so (`wiki-conflicts`).
   - Structure: run `wiki-lint`; the change broke no links and left frontmatter valid.
   - The note says what changed and why.
4. **Act on each change.**
   - Accept: nothing to do.
   - Fix: a small follow-up edit with a note saying what you corrected and why.
   - Revert: `git revert` of that commit, or restore the earlier version on a hosted wiki,
     with a note explaining the reason. Revert the one bad change, not the batch around it.
   - Escalate: anything that needs a person's judgment goes in the digest, unchanged.
5. **Promote drafts.** Pages marked `status: draft` or kept under `drafts/` that pass the
   checks move to their real folder (`wiki-refactor`, move) or lose the draft flag. Drafts
   that fail get a note on what is missing.
6. **Send a digest** to the person who owns the wiki, in chat or email, not as a wiki page:
   how many changes and by whom, what you fixed or reverted and why, drafts promoted, and a
   short list of what needs their call. Five to fifteen lines. Skip it when nothing happened.

## Cadence

Daily for a wiki that several agents write to every day; weekly otherwise; right after any
large ingest or migration. A review that waits a month turns into an audit.

## Pitfalls

- Reviewing the change notes instead of the diffs. Notes say what the writer meant to do.
- Rubber-stamping. If every change is accepted for weeks, check whether you are reading the
  diffs.
- Reverting a whole day's batch for one bad edit.
- Filing the digest in the wiki. It is routine progress; the history already records it.
