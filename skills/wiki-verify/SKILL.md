Use on a schedule, before a decision relies on a page, after a large ingest, or when a page's claims are in doubt."

# Verify a wiki

The known weakness of an LLM wiki is that a wrong claim gets written in once and then cited:
it stops looking like model output and becomes a line other pages build on. Linting finds
broken structure. Verifying finds wrong content, by going back to the sources.

Verification is sampling, not a full audit. A run checks a handful of pages well rather than
the whole wiki badly.

## Pick what to check

Folder wiki: `python3 <wiki-lint skill>/scripts/wiki_lint.py <wiki> --verify-queue 10` ranks
pages by how many pages link to them, how long since anyone checked them, and whether they
cite nothing, are contested, have low confidence, or record a decision. Hosted wiki: rank the
same way from the page list and each page's links in.

Also check, whatever the ranking says:

- the page a decision is about to rely on
- pages written in a large ingest or by a new agent
- any page someone has questioned

Default run: three to five pages, or about twenty claims.

## Steps

1. **Pull out checkable claims.** Numbers, dates, names, quotes, prices, "X does Y"
   statements, and anything stated as a finding. Skip opinions that are marked as opinions.
2. **Open each claim's source.** The raw file, the URL, the page it was derived from. Read the
   part that should support it. If the page gives one source list for everything, find which
   source carries which claim.
3. **Mark each claim** with one of:
   - *supported*: the source says it, in substance.
   - *outdated*: the source, or a newer primary source, now says something else.
   - *unsupported*: the source does not say it, or says something weaker.
   - *unsourced*: nothing is cited.
   - *unreachable*: the link is dead or paywalled. Try an archived copy (web.archive.org)
     before giving up.
4. **Fix the page.**
   - Outdated: update the claim with the new source and date (`wiki-conflicts`, superseded).
   - Unsupported: correct it if you can find what is true, citing that; otherwise weaken it
     to what the source does say, or mark it `(unverified)` and lower `confidence`.
   - Unsourced: find a source and cite it, or label the claim unverified.
   - Unreachable: note it inline ("source offline as of 2026-09-28") so the next check
     does not repeat the search.
5. **Find the copies.** Search the wiki for every corrected claim (the number, the name, the
   key phrase). Fix each page that repeated it. This is the step that stops the error
   compounding.
6. **Record the check.** Set `verified: YYYY-MM-DD` in the frontmatter of each page you
   checked end to end, and leave a change note listing what you corrected. Do not bump
   `verified` on a page you only sampled.
7. **Report**: pages checked, claims checked, how many in each category, corrections made,
   and anything that needs a person (a disputed decision, a claim you could not settle).

## Use a second pair of eyes

A model checking its own synthesis tends to agree with it. Where you can, give each claim and
its source, without the rest of the page, to a separate agent or a different model and ask
only "does this source support this claim?". Disagreements between the two are the claims to
look at closely.

## Pitfalls

- Checking that a source exists instead of reading what it says.
- Accepting a secondary source's paraphrase of a primary one you could open directly.
- Treating a vendor's claim about itself as verified because the vendor's page says it. It
  is *supported* as a vendor claim; keep the vendor-sourced label.
- Fixing the page you checked and leaving the claim on the pages that copied it.
- Marking a page `verified` after spot-checking two claims.
